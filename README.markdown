OAL Wrapper Source Code
=======================

Yes, here is the OpenAL C++ Wrapper that was built and used for the Penumbra series as well as Amnesia: The Dark Descent.

Read through the TODO file for various known things that should be cleaned up / fixed.

Included are project files for Xcode, Cmake (for Linux).

Important
---------

If you want to compile Penumbra: Overture, don't use a commit newer than this one: https://github.com/jorgeas80/OALWrapper/commit/ae59c6d7bd476d4d5c7e4a6cd3323a48ed1a6c9c

The OALWrapper was updated after that commit, to fit into different projects, and cause compilation problems
